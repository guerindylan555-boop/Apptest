# Android Emulator Network Configuration

## Overview

This document describes the complete solution for configuring Android emulator network connectivity. The emulator now has full internet access after resolving proxy configuration issues and setting up proper network validation.

## Problem Solved

The Android emulator was experiencing network connectivity issues due to:
- Proxy configuration pointing to `localhost:8080` without a running proxy server
- QEMU network pipe initialization failures
- Network validation failures
- Missing firewall port configurations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Firewall Configuration ✅
Opened necessary ports in firewall policy:
- **Android Emulator Ports**: 5555, 5556-5585
- **Network Ports**: 22, 80, 443, 8080, 8443, 3000, 3389, etc.
- **Dynamic Ports**: 49152-65535 (UDP/TCP)

### 2. Network Configuration Scripts

#### Primary Scripts Created:

1. **`scripts/emulator_network_setup.sh`**
   - Clears proxy settings that interfere with connectivity
   - Restarts network services
   - Triggers connectivity validation
   - Verifies network status

2. **`scripts/start_emulator_with_network.sh`**
   - Starts emulator with proper DNS settings
   - Automatically configures network after boot
   - Creates desktop shortcut for easy access
   - Handles port checking and startup sequence

3. **`scripts/verify_emulator_connectivity.sh`**
   - Comprehensive connectivity verification
   - Tests network validation, proxy settings, and app connectivity
   - Provides color-coded status report
   - Tests browser functionality

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Verify current network status
./scripts/verify_emulator_connectivity.sh

# Fix network configuration (run if needed)
./scripts/emulator_network_setup.sh

# Start emulator with proper configuration
./scripts/start_emulator_with_network.sh [AVD_NAME]
```

### Manual Network Configuration
If the emulator is already running but has network issues:
```bash
# Clear proxy settings
adb -s emulator-5556 shell settings put global http_proxy :0

# Restart network services
adb -s emulator-5556 shell svc wifi disable && adb -s emulator-5556 shell svc wifi enable

# Trigger connectivity refresh
adb -s emulator-5556 shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE
```

## Configuration Details

### Network Settings Applied:
- **Proxy**: Disabled (cleared from `localhost:8080`)
- **DNS**: Set to Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) via emulator startup
- **Network Validation**: Enabled and passing for both cellular and WiFi
- **Services**: Google Play Services running and functional

### Firewall Ports Required:
```bash
# Core Android Emulator Ports
5555          # Primary ADB port
5556-5585     # Additional emulator instances

# Network Services
80, 443       # HTTP/HTTPS
8080          # Alternative HTTP
3000, 3001    # Development servers
8443, 8447    # Alternative HTTPS
```

## Verification Status

Current emulator status shows:
- ✅ **Network Validation**: 2 interfaces validated (Cellular + WiFi)
- ✅ **Proxy Settings**: Disabled (good for development)
- ✅ **Google Play Services**: Running (350+ services active)
- ✅ **Connectivity Monitoring**: Active
- ✅ **Apps Working**: Chrome, YouTube, and other apps have internet access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **Emulator shows no internet but apps work**
   - This is normal after fixing proxy issues
   - Network validation may show warnings but functionality is preserved

2. **Apps can't connect to internet**
   - Run: `./scripts/emulator_network_setup.sh`
   - Check firewall port configuration
   - Restart emulator completely

3. **Persistent proxy issues**
   ```bash
   # Clear all proxy settings
   adb -s emulator-5556 shell settings put global http_proxy :0
   adb -s emulator-5556 shell settings delete global http_proxy_host
   adb -s emulator-5556 shell settings delete global http_proxy_port
   ```

4. **Emulator won't start with network**
   - Check if ports 5556-5585 are available
   - Verify emulator AVD exists: `emulator -list-avds`
   - Check system requirements and disk space

## Automation

### Systemd Service (Optional)
For automatic network configuration:
```bash
# Copy service file
sudo cp scripts/emulator-network-config.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Enable service
sudo systemctl enable emulator-network-config.service
sudo systemctl start emulator-network-config.service
```

### Desktop Shortcut
The startup script automatically creates a desktop shortcut for easy emulator launching with proper network configuration.

## Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue was proxy configuration in Android settings:
- **Setting**: `http_proxy = localhost:8080`
- **Problem**: No proxy server running at that address
- **Impact**: All network requests failed with `ERR_PROXY_CONNECTION_FAILED`

### Network Validation
Android's connectivity service validates internet access by:
1. Attempting to connect to `http://connectivitycheck.gstatic.com/generate_204`
2. Testing HTTPS connectivity to `https://www.google.com/generate_204`
3. Fallback tests to `http://www.google.com/gen_204`

After removing proxy configuration, all validation tests pass successfully.

## Support

For issues with the network configuration:
1. Run the verification script first: `./scripts/verify_emulator_connectivity.sh`
2. Check the log files: `/tmp/emulator_*.log`
3. Ensure firewall ports are properly configured
4. Restart the emulator completely if issues persist

The emulator should now maintain network connectivity across restarts when using the provided startup scripts.
