---

## 1. API Endpoint Analysis

### 1.1 Lock API (Temporary Pause)

```http
POST https://api.knotcity.io/api/application/vehicles/freefloat/lock/temporary
Authorization: Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "vehicleId": 909,
  "force": false
}
```

**Security Observations:**

#### ‚úÖ Strengths:
- Uses HTTPS (TLS encryption)
- Requires authentication via JWT Bearer token
- Validates token signature and expiration

#### üî¥ Critical Vulnerabilities:

##### **V1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Unauthorized vehicle control

**Description:**
The `vehicleId` parameter is client-controlled and appears to be a simple incremental integer (909). There's no evidence of server-side validation that:
- The authenticated user has an active rental for this specific vehicle
- The user has permission to lock this vehicle
- The vehicle is actually near the user's location

**Exploitation Scenario:**
```bash
# Attacker could iterate through vehicle IDs to lock ANY scooter
for vehicleId in {1..10000}; do
  curl -X POST 'https://api.knotcity.io/api/application/vehicles/freefloat/lock/temporary' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $STOLEN_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"vehicleId\": $vehicleId, \"force\": false}"
done
```

**Business Impact:**
- Mass disruption: Lock all scooters in fleet
- Denial of service to legitimate users
- Safety hazard if scooter locked while in motion
- Revenue loss from unavailable vehicles

**Proof of Vulnerability:**
- Client sends arbitrary `vehicleId` value
- No trip ID correlation required
- No location proximity check visible in request

---

##### **V2: Missing Geolocation Validation**
**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH
**Impact:** Remote locking of vehicles

**Description:**
The lock request does NOT include:
- User's current GPS coordinates
- Vehicle's last known position
- Proximity verification

**Expected Behavior:**
Server should verify user is within ~50m of the vehicle before allowing lock.

**Actual Behavior:**
Request accepted without location data, suggesting server-side proximity checks may be missing or weak.

**Exploitation:**
- User could lock scooter remotely from anywhere in the world
- Enables "griefing" attacks on other users
- Allows locking competitor's vehicles if credentials compromised

---

##### **V3: Force Parameter Concerns**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Override safety mechanisms

**Description:**
The `"force": false` parameter suggests there's a `"force": true` option that may bypass safety checks.

**Questions:**
- What does `force: true` bypass?
- Speed checks?
- Motion detection?
- Other user's active rental?

**Recommended Testing:**
```bash
# Test if force=true bypasses restrictions
curl -X POST 'https://api.knotcity.io/api/application/vehicles/freefloat/lock/temporary' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"vehicleId": 909, "force": true}'
```

---

### 1.2 Unlock API (Resume Trip)

```http
PUT https://api.knotcity.io/api/application/trips/321668/resume
Authorization: Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}
```

**Security Observations:**

#### ‚úÖ Strengths:
- Uses trip ID instead of vehicle ID (better security model)
- REST-compliant verb (PUT for state update)
- HTTPS encryption

#### üî¥ Critical Vulnerabilities:

##### **V4: Predictable Trip IDs**
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Unauthorized trip resumption

**Description:**
Trip ID `321668` appears to be a sequential integer. If trip IDs are predictable and not properly authorized:

**Attack Vectors:**
```bash
# Enumerate valid trip IDs
for tripId in {320000..330000}; do
  response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
    -X PUT "https://api.knotcity.io/api/application/trips/$tripId/resume" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN")

  if [ "$response" == "200" ]; then
    echo "Successfully resumed trip $tripId (not mine!)"
  fi
done
```

**Consequences:**
- Attacker could resume OTHER users' paused trips
- Financial fraud: Resume expensive trips on victim's account
- Location tracking: Determine which trips are active
- Privacy violation: Inference of user behavior patterns

---

##### **V5: Missing Trip Ownership Validation**
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Account takeover implications

**Description:**
The JWT token contains `user_id: 117953`, but there's no visible correlation between this and the trip ID in the request.

**Server MUST validate:**
```sql
SELECT user_id FROM trips WHERE trip_id = 321668
-- Then verify: user_id == JWT.user_id
```

**If missing, attacker could:**
1. Enumerate trip IDs via timing attacks
2. Resume trips belonging to other users
3. Potentially unlock vehicles being used by others
4. Cause financial charges to wrong accounts

---

##### **V6: State Transition Vulnerabilities**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** Business logic bypass

**Questions:**
- Can you resume a trip that was never paused?
- Can you resume a completed trip?
- Can you resume someone else's active trip (hijack)?
- What happens if two users resume the same trip simultaneously?

**Race Condition Example:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Legitimate user
curl -X PUT 'https://api.knotcity.io/api/application/trips/321668/resume'

# Terminal 2: Attacker (simultaneously)
curl -X PUT 'https://api.knotcity.io/api/application/trips/321668/resume'

# Outcome: Both succeed? First wins? Last wins? Undefined behavior?
```

## 2. Authentication & Authorization Analysis

### 2.1 JWT Token Structure

```json
{
  "user_id": 117953,
  "session_id": "f4ef83da-21b0-4deb-b7f6-f801c7438577",
  "iat": 1761295980,
  "exp": 1761299580
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Strengths:
- Proper expiration (1 hour TTL)
- Session ID for revocation capability
- Issued timestamp for audit trails

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns:

##### **C1: Token Lifetime**
- 1 hour is relatively long for high-value operations
- If token stolen, attacker has 1-hour window
- **Recommendation:** Implement sliding sessions or shorter TTL for sensitive ops

##### **C2: No Operation Scope**
- Token grants full account access
- Missing fine-grained permissions (e.g., "can_lock", "can_unlock")
- **Recommendation:** Implement OAuth2 scopes or permission claims

##### **C3: Session Management**
Token includes `session_id`, suggesting session tracking capability:

**Questions:**
- Is there a logout/revoke endpoint?
- Can user view active sessions?
- Are sessions invalidated on password change?
- Is there concurrent session limiting?

---

### 2.2 Authorization Flaws

**Current State:**
```
JWT Valid? ‚Üí Allow Operation
```

**Secure Model Should Be:**
```
1. JWT Valid?
2. User owns this trip/vehicle?
3. User is physically near vehicle? (for lock/unlock)
4. Operation allowed in current state?
5. No conflicting operations?
‚Üí Then Allow Operation
```

**Missing Checks:**
- [ ] Resource ownership validation
- [ ] Proximity-based authorization
- [ ] State-aware permissions
- [ ] Rate limiting per user/resource

---

## 3. Business Logic Vulnerabilities

### 3.1 Pause/Resume Flow Abuse

**Observed Behavior:**
1. User unlocks scooter (starts trip)
2. User rides to destination A
3. User pauses (locks temporarily) via API
4. User walks to nearby location B
5. User resumes trip via API
6. Final trip shows path A‚ÜíB but user didn't ride that segment

**Potential Exploits:**

#### **E1: Fare Evasion**
```
Scenario: Pay-per-minute pricing
1. Start trip at location A
2. Ride 10 minutes to location B (legitimate riding)
3. Pause trip
4. Wait at location B for 2 hours (no charges during pause)
5. Resume trip
6. Ride 5 minutes to final destination
7. End trip

Actual time: 15 minutes of riding + 2 hours pause
User pays: 15 minutes only (pause is free!)
```

**Mitigation Check:**
- Does API limit pause duration?
- Does API charge for pause time?
- Maximum number of pauses per trip?

---

#### **E2: Location Spoofing in Pause State**

**Attack:**
```
1. Start trip legitimately
2. Pause trip
3. Physically move scooter while paused (no GPS tracking during pause?)
4. Resume trip at new location
5. End trip

Result: Trip shows teleportation, avoiding zone restrictions
```

**If GPS not tracked during pause:**
- User could move scooter out of allowed zones
- Violate parking restrictions
- Bypass geographic rate zones

---

### 3.2 Concurrent Operation Vulnerabilities

**Race Condition Tests Needed:**

```bash
# Test 1: Double pause
Terminal 1: POST /lock/temporary (vehicleId=909)
Terminal 2: POST /lock/temporary (vehicleId=909)  # Same vehicle
# What happens? Two "pauses" on same trip?

# Test 2: Pause-Resume race
Terminal 1: POST /lock/temporary (vehicleId=909)
Terminal 2: PUT /trips/321668/resume  # Immediate resume
# Can you resume before lock completes?

# Test 3: Multi-user conflict
User A: PUT /trips/321668/resume (has valid token for trip)
User B: PUT /trips/321668/resume (stolen token)
# Who gets the vehicle?
```

**Potential Issues:**
- Database race conditions
- Inconsistent state (locked AND unlocked simultaneously)
- Financial discrepancies (double charging/no charging)

---

## 4. Network & Transport Security

### 4.1 TLS/HTTPS Implementation

#### ‚úÖ Observed:
- All traffic over HTTPS
- Using `api.knotcity.io` domain

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended Verification:
```bash
# Test TLS configuration
testssl.sh https://api.knotcity.io

# Check for:
- TLS 1.2+ only?
- Strong cipher suites?
- HSTS headers?
- Certificate pinning in mobile app?
```

### 4.2 Certificate Pinning

**Critical for Mobile Apps:**
- Is certificate pinning implemented?
- We were able to intercept traffic using Frida
- This means either:
  1. No certificate pinning (VULNERABLE)
  2. Pinning bypassed via Frida (expected in rooted environment)

**For Production App:**
Should implement:
- Certificate pinning
- SSL pinning bypass detection
- Root/jailbreak detection

---

## 5. Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Mass Vehicle Locking Attack

**Attacker Profile:** Malicious user with valid account

**Steps:**
1. Authenticate and obtain JWT token
2. Enumerate vehicle IDs (1-10000)
3. Send lock requests for all vehicles
4. All scooters in city become unavailable

**Impact:**
- Complete service disruption
- Financial loss (no rentals possible)
- Reputational damage
- Safety issues (emergency users can't access scooters)

**Likelihood:** HIGH (if IDOR exists)

---

### Scenario 2: Trip Hijacking

**Attacker Profile:** Sophisticated attacker with stolen token

**Steps:**
1. Obtain valid JWT token (phishing, MITM, etc.)
2. Enumerate active trip IDs
3. Call resume API on victim's paused trip
4. Victim loses access to their scooter
5. Attacker gains access or causes victim to be charged

**Impact:**
- Financial fraud
- Service denial to legitimate user
- Safety risk if user stranded

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM-HIGH (depends on trip ID validation)

---

### Scenario 3: Location Privacy Attack

**Attacker Profile:** Stalker or competitor

**Steps:**
1. Enumerate trip IDs for specific time period
2. Call resume/lock APIs with timing analysis
3. Determine which trips are active and where
4. Track user movements over time

**Impact:**
- Privacy violation
- Stalking enablement
- Competitive intelligence (usage patterns)

**Likelihood:** MEDIUM

---

### Scenario 4: Automated Fare Evasion

**Attacker Profile:** Cost-conscious user with technical skills

**Steps:**
1. Create automated script:
```python
import time

def cheap_ride(start, destination):
    unlock_scooter()
    ride_to(destination)
    lock_scooter()  # Pause, no charges
    time.sleep(7200)  # Wait 2 hours
    resume_scooter()  # Resume for free
    ride_final_segment()
    end_trip()
    # Only charged for riding time, not waiting time
```

**Impact:**
- Revenue loss
- Unfair advantage over honest users
- Resource hogging (scooter unavailable during pause)

**Likelihood:** HIGH (easy to implement)

---

## 6. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)

#### R1: Implement Resource Ownership Validation
```python
# Server-side check on EVERY lock/unlock request
def lock_vehicle(user_id, vehicle_id):
    # Verify user has active rental for THIS vehicle
    trip = db.query(
        "SELECT * FROM trips WHERE user_id = ? AND vehicle_id = ? AND status = 'active'",
        user_id, vehicle_id
    )

    if not trip:
        raise Unauthorized("No active trip for this vehicle")

    # Proceed with lock
```

#### R2: Add Proximity Validation
```python
def lock_vehicle(user_id, vehicle_id, user_lat, user_lon):
    vehicle_location = get_vehicle_gps(vehicle_id)
    distance = calculate_distance(user_lat, user_lon, vehicle_location)

    if distance > 50:  # 50 meters
        raise ValidationError("User must be within 50m of vehicle to lock")
```

#### R3: Implement Rate Limiting
```python
# Redis-based rate limiting
@rate_limit(max_calls=10, period=60)  # 10 locks per minute
def lock_vehicle(user_id, vehicle_id):
    # ...
```

#### R4: Add Trip ID Authorization
```python
def resume_trip(user_id, trip_id):
    trip = db.get_trip(trip_id)

    if trip.user_id != user_id:
        log_security_event("Unauthorized trip access attempt",
                          user_id, trip_id)
        raise Unauthorized("Not your trip")

    if trip.status != 'paused':
        raise ValidationError("Can only resume paused trips")
```

---

### Short-term Improvements

#### I1: Enhanced JWT Claims
```json
{
  "user_id": 117953,
  "session_id": "...",
  "permissions": ["ride", "lock", "unlock"],
  "active_trip_id": 321668,  // Bind token to specific trip
  "active_vehicle_id": 909,   // Bind token to specific vehicle
  "iat": 1761295980,
  "exp": 1761299580,
  "jti": "unique-token-id"    // For revocation
}
```

#### I2: Operation Logging & Monitoring
```python
# Log all sensitive operations
audit_log.record({
    "user_id": user_id,
    "operation": "vehicle_lock",
    "vehicle_id": vehicle_id,
    "trip_id": trip_id,
    "user_location": {"lat": lat, "lon": lon},
    "vehicle_location": {"lat": v_lat, "lon": v_lon},
    "distance": distance,
    "timestamp": now(),
    "ip_address": request.ip,
    "user_agent": request.headers["User-Agent"]
})

# Alert on anomalies
if distance > 100 or rate > threshold:
    alert_security_team(user_id, operation)
```

#### I3: State Machine Validation
```python
VALID_TRANSITIONS = {
    'active': ['paused', 'completed'],
    'paused': ['active', 'completed'],
    'completed': []
}

def resume_trip(trip_id):
    trip = db.get_trip(trip_id)

    if 'active' not in VALID_TRANSITIONS[trip.status]:
        raise ValidationError(f"Cannot resume from {trip.status}")
```

---

### Long-term Architectural Changes

#### A1: Move to Challenge-Response for Sensitive Ops
```
Client: "I want to unlock vehicle 909"
Server: "Prove you're near vehicle 909"
Client: Provides GPS + signed challenge
Server: Validates proximity + signature ‚Üí Unlock
```

#### A2: Implement Vehicle-Side Validation
- Vehicle should verify lock/unlock commands
- Cryptographic signing of commands
- Vehicle GPS must match user GPS
- Time-bound unlock codes

#### A3: Blockchain/Audit Trail
- Immutable log of all vehicle operations
- Detect tampering or unauthorized access
- Regulatory compliance
- Dispute resolution
