# Tasks: APK Upload & Install + Frida & Tooling

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/ubuntu/project/Apptest/specs/002-apk-upload-install/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/backend-api.yaml

**Tests**: Tests are NOT requested in the specification. No test tasks are included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Extends existing structure from feature 001-web-ui-read

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Cross-Cutting (Phase 7)**: Can start after Phase 2, develops in parallel with user stories
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories (independent)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories (independent)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories (independent)

### Within Each User Story

- Models/types before services
- Services before routes
- Routes before UI components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All tasks marked [P] (T001, T002, T003, T004) can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: All tasks marked [P] (T005-T009, T011-T017) can run in parallel

  - T018, T019, T020 can run in parallel
  - T025, T026, T027 can run in parallel
  - T031, T032 can run in parallel
  - T034, T035 can run in parallel
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: T043, T044, T045 can run in parallel; T060 can run in parallel with backend tasks
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: T065, T066, T067, T073, T074 can run in parallel; T084, T085 can run in parallel with backend tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: T092, T093, T094 can run in parallel; T105 can run in parallel with backend tasks
- **Phase 7**: T112, T113 can run in parallel
- **Phase 8**: T121, T122, T127 can run in parallel
- **User Stories 1-4 can all proceed in parallel** if team has capacity (all are independent)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T017) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T018-T042)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently per acceptance scenarios
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently per spec.md scenarios ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently per spec.md scenarios ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently per spec.md scenarios ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (optional) ‚Üí Test independently per spec.md scenarios ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (P1) - APK upload/install
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (P2) - Frida instrumentation
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (P3) - Traffic capture
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (P4) - MobSF scanning (optional)
   - Developer E: Phase 7 - Status monitoring (can start after Phase 2)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Tests are NOT included per specification (no TDD requested)
