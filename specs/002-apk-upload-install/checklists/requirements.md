# Specification Quality Checklist: APK Upload & Install + Frida & Tooling (Local-Only)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec is written from user/tester perspective. Technical details like ADB commands appear in FR requirements but are implementation-neutral (describing "what" the system must do, not "how" to build it architecturally).

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No unexplained [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (3 open questions properly formatted with options)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**:
- Three open questions remain with multiple-choice answers provided (MobSF default behavior, Android 14+ CA strategy, Objection hints).
- Success Criteria focus on measurable outcomes (time, percentage, user experience) rather than implementation specifics.
- 54 functional requirements with clear MUST/SHOULD/MAY priorities.
- 9 edge cases documented with expected behavior.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**:
- 4 user stories (P1-P4) with independent test descriptions
- Each story has 3-5 acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- Success criteria tied directly to user stories (upload speed, workflow completion time, error handling)

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… **PASSED** - Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

All checklist items pass. The specification:
- Contains no implementation details at the architectural level
- Provides clear, testable requirements organized by functional area
- Includes 3 well-formatted open questions for user clarification
- Defines measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Documents comprehensive edge cases, risks, dependencies, and assumptions
- Follows constitution principles (localhost-only, opt-in tooling, 30-day retention)

## Open Questions Summary

The specification includes 3 clarification questions (within the recommended maximum):

1. **MobSF Default Behavior** - Should scans be opt-in, auto-enabled, or configurable? (Recommendation: Option A - Strictly opt-in)
2. **Android 14+ CA Installation Strategy** - Prefer Magisk-module route or Frida bypass? (Recommendation: Option A - Magisk-module route)
3. **Objection Attach Hints** - Display hints prominently, hide them, or use expandable tips? (Recommendation: Option C - Expandable tips section)

These questions do not block planning but will refine user experience details.

## Next Steps

1. **Optional**: Run `/speckit.clarify` to resolve the 3 open questions with user input
2. **Proceed to**: `/speckit.plan` to create technical architecture and implementation approach
3. **After planning**: `/speckit.tasks` to generate work breakdown for implementation
