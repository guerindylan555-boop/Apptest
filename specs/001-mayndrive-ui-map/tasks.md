# Tasks: MaynDrive State-Aware UI Mapping

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-mayndrive-ui-map/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification, so this task list focuses on implementation tasks only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Per plan.md, this project uses:
- **Backend**: `backend/src/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`
- **Artifacts**: `var/`
- **Scripts**: `scripts/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T004 [P] Add configuration schema for detector thresholds in backend/src/config/detector.ts

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T014 Implement graph storage service with JSON persistence in backend/src/services/graphStore.ts
- [x] T015 [P] Implement artifact storage service with filesystem operations in backend/src/services/artifactStore.ts
- [x] T016 Setup ADB/UIAutomator integration utility in backend/src/utils/adb.ts
- [x] T017 [P] Setup Frida hook integration utility in backend/src/utils/frida.ts
- [x] T018 Create base REST API routes structure in backend/src/api/routes.ts
- [x] T019 [P] Setup Zustand store structure in frontend/src/stores/uiGraphStore.ts

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Capture & Graph Screens (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Operators can capture any MaynDrive screen (clean boot, arbitrary login credentials, and post-login home variants), assign a human-readable name, store artifacts, and define outgoing actions so the UI graph grows intentionally.

**Independent Test**: Start from an unmapped screen, capture it, define at least one outgoing action, and verify the node plus artifacts persist independently of other stories.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Detect Screen State Reliably (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: The system can ingest a fresh dump from the emulator and identify the most likely node(s) using stored signatures and selectors, or escalate when confidence is low.

**Independent Test**: Provide a mix of known and unknown screen dumps, run detection, and inspect whether top-K scoring plus UNKNOWN handling works without invoking flow execution.

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Build & Replay Flows (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Product specialists define flows (login ‚Üí unlock ‚Üí lock) declaratively from the graph, and the runner executes them from any starting screen using state-aware routing and recovery, covering both "no rental yet" and "existing rental" unlock/lock behaviors.

**Independent Test**: Author a flow referencing graph nodes, then invoke the runner from arbitrary emulator states to confirm it reaches the target outcome while enforcing postconditions.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1's graph nodes but detector is independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on US2 completion for detection during flow execution; integrates with US1's graph structure

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1**:
- T021-T023 can run in parallel (different utilities)
- T024 depends on T021-T023
- T026-T027 can run in parallel (different UI components)
- T031 can run in parallel with T029-T030
- T033-T034 can run in parallel (different UI components)

**User Story 2**:
- T039-T041 can run in parallel (different scoring strategies)
- T042-T043 depend on T039-T041
- T045-T046 can run in parallel (different UI components)

**User Story 3**:
- T054-T056 can run in parallel (different services)
- T063-T064 can run in parallel (different UI components)
- T070-T073 can run in parallel (different flow files)

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each user story, all tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (4 tasks)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (16 tasks - CRITICAL, blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Capture & Graph Screens (18 tasks)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Manually capture multiple screens, define actions, verify artifacts persist
5. Demo capture workflow to stakeholders

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (20 tasks)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! 18 additional tasks = 38 total)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (15 additional tasks = 53 total)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (26 additional tasks = 79 total)
5. Polish phase ‚Üí Production ready (15 additional tasks = 94 total)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (20 tasks)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (capture system - 18 tasks)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (detector system - 15 tasks, can start in parallel)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (flow runner system - 26 tasks, starts after US2 detection service is complete)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Success Criteria Alignment

Tasks are designed to satisfy the spec's measurable outcomes:

- **SC-001** (Capture in <30s): Validated by T089 performance optimization
- **SC-002** (Detect ‚â•90% accuracy, <2s): Validated by T090 performance optimization
- **SC-003** (Flow execution ‚â§1 intervention 95% runs): Validated by T088 quickstart scenarios
- **SC-004** (Author flow <60min, <1MB artifacts): Validated by T080 README and T081 size tracking

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within their group
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All TypeScript must compile under strict mode (Constitution ¬ß9)
- All artifacts stored under `var/` volume (Constitution ¬ß7)
- No new services or ingress introduced (Constitution ¬ß¬ß2, 3)
- WebRTC bridge preserved, no ws-scrcpy (Constitution ¬ß4)
