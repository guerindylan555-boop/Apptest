# Tasks: UI Map & Discovery System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ui-map-flow-engine/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are not explicitly requested in the feature specification for Phase 1 - focusing on discovery functionality.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/` (per plan.md)
- **Data volume**: `/app/data/` for graph.json and session logs

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and data volume configuration

- [X] T001 Add discovery-data volume to docker-compose.yml for persistent graph storage
- [X] T002 [P] Add discovery system environment variables to .env configuration
- [X] T003 [P] Create /app/data directory structure with proper permissions

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 Copy TypeScript types from contracts/types.ts to backend/src/types/graph.ts

- [X] T009 Add /api/healthz endpoint to backend/src/routes/health.ts for system monitoring
- [X] T009.5 [P] Add frontend health endpoint in frontend/src/components/HealthEndpoint.tsx for constitution compliance

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Manual State Discovery & Mapping (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable manual navigation with automatic UI state capture and graph building

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2) or in parallel
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Core discovery functionality
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after US1 - Depends on captured states and graph structure
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after US2 - Depends on flow definitions and state graph
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after US3 - Depends on complete graph and flow system

### Within Each User Story

- Utilities and services before endpoints and UI components
- Core functionality before integration and advanced features
- Each story should be independently testable before proceeding

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: All foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Within Stories**: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel by different developers
- **Across Stories**: US1, US2, US3 can be developed in parallel by different team members after foundational phase

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all backend services for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create introspection service in backend/src/services/introspectService.ts"
Task: "Create graph service in backend/src/services/graphService.ts"
Task: "Create useDiscovery hook in frontend/src/hooks/useDiscovery.ts"

# Launch all UI components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create DiscoveryPanel component in frontend/src/components/apps/DiscoveryPanel.tsx"
Task: "Update featureFlagsStore.ts to enable discoveryPanel and disable gpsPanel"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Manual discovery)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test state capture and graph building independently
5. Deploy/demo core discovery functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Discovery foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Core discovery MVP
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Flow authoring capability
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Intelligent replay system
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí LLM assistance features
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous functionality

### Performance Targets

- **State capture**: <1s total including ADB operations
- **Graph validation**: <2s for 50 states, 100 transitions
- **API responses**: <500ms p95
- **Memory usage**: <100MB for typical graphs
- **Graph size**: Support up to 500 states, 2000 transitions

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Follow performance targets defined in plan.md and research.md
- All data persisted to /app/data volume for version control
- TypeScript strict mode maintained throughout implementation
- Container-based architecture per constitution requirements
