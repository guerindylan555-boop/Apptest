**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Integration test harness included (emulator-driven scenarios as specified in research.md)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 graph structures
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 (states) and US2 (flows)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1, US2, US3 outputs

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all P1 user stories can start in parallel
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Frontend and backend tasks for the same story can often run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Integration test for UI state capture via UIAutomator2 in backend/tests/integration/state-capture.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test for state deduplication accuracy in backend/tests/integration/state-dedup.test.ts"
Task: "Integration test for graph JSON serialization in backend/tests/integration/graph-serialization.test.ts"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create State entity and selector logic in backend/src/models/state.ts"
Task: "Create Transition entity model in backend/src/models/transition.ts"
Task: "Create UI Graph (UTG) entity in backend/src/models/graph.ts"

# Launch frontend components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Discovery panel React component in frontend/src/components/DiscoveryPanel.tsx"
Task: "Create state visualization components in frontend/src/components/StateGraph.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (UI Capture & Graph)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Flow Definition)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Flow Replay)
3. User Story 4 (LLM Integration) can be added by any developer after P1 stories are stable

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (test-driven approach for integration tests)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All JSON artifacts stored under version control with conflict resolution
- WebRTC timeouts must respect 1.5s constitution requirement
- Performance targets: <2s validation for 50-state graphs, ‚â•80% recovery success rate
