# AutoApp Platform Constitution Draft

## Project Identity

**Project Name**: AutoApp
**Mission**: Local Android application testing and automation platform
**Type**: Containerized development environment for app analysis

## Core Principles

### 1. Local Development Environment
- The platform MUST run entirely in Docker containers on localhost
- All services MUST bind to 127.0.0.1 unless explicitly configured otherwise
- Remote access is NOT supported in the base configuration

### 2. WebRTC-based Emulator Streaming
- Android emulator video streaming MUST use WebRTC via gRPC-Web bridge
- Input events MUST be relayed through the same WebRTC channel
- Envoy proxy MUST handle gRPC-Web translation to emulator gRPC endpoints

### 3. Frida Integration for Dynamic Analysis
- Frida server MUST be available for runtime instrumentation
- API capture scripts MUST use JavaScript hooks for method interception
- All captured data MUST be stored locally in structured format

### 4. Container-based Architecture
- Backend (Node.js/TypeScript) MUST run in Docker container
- Frontend (React/TypeScript) MUST run in Docker container
- Android emulator MUST run in Docker container with host networking
- Envoy proxy MUST handle external WebRTC connections

### 5. ADB Control and Management
- ADB connections MUST be managed through container networking
- App installation/uninstall MUST go through ADB API endpoints
- Device state MUST be queryable through backend services

### 6. State Management and Persistence
- Application state MUST be managed through backend APIs
- Emulator state MUST persist across container restarts
- Captured data MUST be stored in mounted volumes

### 7. Development Tool Integration
- The platform MUST support manual testing through web interface
- Automated script execution MUST be supported through backend APIs
- Logging and monitoring MUST be accessible through web interface

## Architecture Constraints

### Backend Requirements
- Node.js 20+ with TypeScript
- Express.js for REST API
- WebSocket support for real-time communication
- Integration with Android SDK tools
- Frida control and script management

### Frontend Requirements
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- WebRTC video streaming component
- Interactive control overlay
- Script management interface
- Real-time log viewing

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Docker Compose for orchestration
- Android emulator container with KVM support
- Envoy proxy for gRPC-Web translation
- Volume mounts for persistent data
- Host networking for emulator container

### Emulator Configuration
- Android API 30+ x86_64 image
- WebRTC enabled for video streaming
- ADB debugging enabled
- GPS spoofing support via gpsd container

## Quality Standards

### Reliability
- WebRTC connections MUST auto-reconnect on failure
- Container restarts MUST preserve emulator state
- API endpoints MUST handle concurrent requests gracefully
- Error responses MUST include actionable error messages

### Performance
- Video streaming latency MUST be under 200ms
- API response times MUST be under 1 second for most operations
- Container startup time MUST be under 2 minutes
- Memory usage MUST stay within allocated limits

### Security
- ADB authentication MUST be properly configured
- Container isolation MUST prevent host access
- Network access MUST be limited to required services
- Sensitive data MUST not be logged in plain text

## Data Management

### Storage Structure
- `/var/autoapp` for application data and logs
- Separate directories for different apps under test
- Structured logging with timestamps and correlation IDs
- Automatic cleanup of old data based on configurable policies

### Capture Data
- Frida script outputs MUST be saved with metadata
- Screenshots MUST be captured during automation
- Network traffic MAY be captured when explicitly enabled
- All data MUST be stored in JSON format for easy parsing

## Governance

### Modification Process
- Changes to architecture MUST be documented
- New services MUST follow existing patterns
- Breaking changes MUST increment version numbers
- All changes MUST maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Compliance
- Regular testing of container startup and shutdown
- Verification of WebRTC streaming functionality
- Testing of ADB integration and app management
- Validation of Frida script execution

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- Local Android app testing and automation
- Web-based emulator control interface
- Frida-based runtime analysis
- Container-based development environment
- API capture and replay functionality

### Out of Scope
- Remote device management
- Multi-user concurrent access
- Cloud deployment scenarios
- Production app distribution
- Mobile device management

## Acceptance Criteria

### Basic Functionality
- User can launch the platform with `docker-compose up`
- Web interface loads at http://localhost:5173
- Emulator video appears in web interface
- User can interact with emulator through web controls
- Apps can be installed through the web interface

### Advanced Features
- Frida scripts can be uploaded and executed
- API calls are captured and displayed in real-time
- Screenshots can be captured on demand
- GPS location can be spoofed through the interface
- Logs are accessible through the web interface

### Reliability
- Platform survives container restarts
- WebRTC automatically reconnects after network issues
- Emulator state is preserved across restarts
- Error conditions are clearly communicated to user

## Questions for Constitution Finalization

1. **Version Management**: How should we handle versioning of the platform itself?
2. **Data Retention**: What should be the default retention policy for captured data?
3. **Access Control**: Should there be any form of authentication for the web interface?
4. **Backup Strategy**: How should emulator state and captured data be backed up?
5. **Monitoring**: What metrics should be tracked for platform health?
6. **Extensibility**: How should third-party plugins or extensions be handled?
7. **Documentation**: What level of documentation is required for new features?
8. **Testing**: What automated testing should be in place for the platform?

## Next Steps

1. Review and validate the principles outlined above
2. Answer the questions to finalize governance details
3. Create implementation roadmap based on accepted principles
4. Establish development workflow aligned with constitution
5. Set up monitoring and compliance checking
