# Current System Status

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Core Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Docker Compose multi-container setup
- ‚úÖ Backend API running on port 3001
- ‚úÖ Frontend serving on port 5173
- ‚úÖ ws-scrcpy streaming service on port 8000
- ‚úÖ ADB server in network mode (containers can share ADB)
- ‚úÖ Volume mounts for app library and logs
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling throughout automation

### Emulator & Streaming
- ‚úÖ x86_64 Android Emulator (API 33) boots successfully (~90 seconds)
- ‚úÖ ws-scrcpy can detect and connect to emulator
- ‚úÖ Stream URL generation works
- ‚úÖ Stream is accessible in browser

### Automation
- ‚úÖ Auto-startup automation triggers after emulator boots
- ‚úÖ CA certificate installation (mitmproxy)
- ‚úÖ Proxy capture setup (logs to `/var/autoapp/apps/logs/proxy-capture.log`)
- ‚úÖ XAPK file detection and extraction
- ‚úÖ Split APK installation using `install-multiple`
- ‚úÖ Automation logs saved to `/var/autoapp/apps/logs/auto-startup.log`
- ‚úÖ Non-fatal error handling (automation failures don't crash backend)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitation

### App Architecture Compatibility

**Issue**: The "Mayn Drive_1.1.34.xapk" app contains ARM-only native libraries.

**Error**:
```
INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS: Failed to extract native libraries
```

**Root Cause**:
- The app only includes ARM64 (arm64-v8a) native libraries
- Our emulator is x86_64 (required for performance in Docker on x86 hosts)
- ARM64 emulation on x86 hosts is too slow and doesn't work reliably in Docker

**Solutions** (choose one):

1. **Replace with x86-compatible app** (Recommended)
   - Find an XAPK/APK that includes x86_64 libraries
   - Most popular apps (Chrome, Facebook, etc.) include multiple ABIs
   - Place the new XAPK in `var/autoapp/apps/library/`

2. **Use APK-only version**
   - Some apps provide separate APKs for different architectures
   - Download the x86_64 or universal APK version

3. **Test on ARM hardware** (Advanced)
   - Deploy on ARM-based cloud instance (AWS Graviton, Oracle ARM, etc.)
   - Use ARM64 emulator image (already configured in code, just needs ARM host)

## üìä Test Results

### Successfully Tested:
- ‚úÖ Emulator starts and boots
- ‚úÖ ADB connects to emulator
- ‚úÖ ws-scrcpy detects emulator
- ‚úÖ Stream URL accessible
- ‚úÖ Automation runs without crashing
- ‚úÖ Certificate installation
- ‚úÖ Proxy capture
- ‚úÖ XAPK extraction
- ‚úÖ Split APK installation command

### Blocked by App Compatibility:
- ‚è∏Ô∏è App installation (needs x86-compatible app)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è App launch (depends on installation)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Full end-to-end workflow (depends on app launch)

## üöÄ How to Test with a Compatible App

1. **Find an x86-compatible APK/XAPK**
   - Check APKMirror, APKPure for apps with multiple ABIs
   - Look for "armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64" in the supported architectures

2. **Add it to the library**
   ```bash
   cp your-app.xapk /home/blhack/project/Apptest/var/autoapp/apps/library/
   ```

3. **Wait for Dokploy rebuild** (automatic on git push)
   Or manually rebuild: `docker restart apptest-backend`

4. **Start the emulator**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://your-domain/api/emulator/start
   ```

5. **Wait ~90 seconds** for automation to complete

6. **Access the stream**
   - Open frontend: `http://your-domain:5173`
   - Stream should show with app running

## üîß API Endpoints

```bash
# Start emulator
POST http://localhost:3001/api/emulator/start

# Stop emulator
POST http://localhost:3001/api/emulator/stop

# Check health
GET http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Get stream URL
GET http://localhost:3001/api/stream/url

# View automation logs
GET http://localhost:3001/api/automation/logs/startup
GET http://localhost:3001/api/automation/logs/proxy
```

## üìÅ Important Directories

- `/var/autoapp/apps/library/` - Place XAPK/APK files here
- `/var/autoapp/apps/logs/` - Automation and proxy logs
- `/root/.mitmproxy/` - Certificate files

## Next Steps

**Action Required**: Provide an x86_64-compatible app to complete end-to-end testing.

Without a compatible app, the system is fully functional but cannot demonstrate the complete workflow (install ‚Üí launch ‚Üí stream ‚Üí interact).
